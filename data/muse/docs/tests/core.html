--:# Managing state: clone table, generate closure for session (non-persistent) state, cache loads    

--:# Table Utilities: merging tables and finding common items in a pair of tables    

--:# Making Strings: both instantiable strings and simple single quoted strings for printing    

--:# Handling errors and reporting operations    

--:#  Defensive programming: checking dead reckoning when logging or reporting status     

--:# Logging and Quit Control Globals    

--:- quit message -> Set quit flag to message; next core.status throws error to abort operations.      
--:+ If player, status report is printed and potentially logged. Otherwise sent to player using Muse Status (MS) protocol.        
--:+ If for in-game turtle with GPS and the dead reckoning and GPS disagree, include that in report.    

--:# User interface utilities    

--:- echo arguments ... -> For testing: just returns its arguments.    

--:# Math utilities      
--:+ Addend is used to create a vector pair to be added cumulatively beginning with start bounds for result.        
--:+ The number n is the number of bounds in result where each bound is offset by addend from the prior bounds.        
--:+ Optionally the partial bounds are included as the first bounds in the result.      
--:+ Turn from up north to face, default for no face is to rotate -90 degrees.    

--:# Example iterator, restartable at index    

--:# Iterator for coroutine partials of permutations (adapted from Programming in Lua)    

--:# Abstracting over actions: reference implementations of some higher order functions    

--:# When there's no OS, mock it
