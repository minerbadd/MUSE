Name and rename some places and verify their coordinates

Match a place and find distance between places

Iterate over places near specified coordinate

Apply place.near to get distance sorted table of all named places

Then erase one place and get one fewer

Move between two places; setup to create a trail

Check that trail is created and move along it

test2	{10, 25, 35, }	test1	{10, 20, 30, }	head2	{10, 25, 35, }	tail1	{10, 20, 30, }

Then step along it forward and reverse

Get situation and provide a feature

Close test object, report completion if we got here without errors
