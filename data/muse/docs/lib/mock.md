--:! { turtle: []: (:), commands: []: (:) } <- **Mock Functions Library** (for out-of-game test) -> muse/docs//lib/mock.md     
--:| mock: _Libraries to provide a limited simulation of turtle and command computer in-game operations._ -> mock    
--:+ turtle: _Generally just returns success but allows for simulated blocking, fuel consumption, refueling._      
--:+ commands: _Mock returns from command computer and report success._  

--:# _Mock turtle has coal, torches, fences, dirt, ladders, wheat seeds, reeds, sand, and saplings._    
--:+ _As well as barrels, granite, potatoes, carrots, beetroot seeds, and kelp._    
--:+ _And advanced computers, ender modems, disk drives and floppies in its slots._  

--:# _Inspection shows dirt for down direction, otherwise nothing._  

--:# turtle.block(blocked: ^:) -> _Sets blocked status to `blocked` for debug_ -> blocked: `^:`  

--:# _Turns just report success, other motions decrement the simulated fuel and report success unless blocked._    
--:+ _Only forward motion can be blocked in simulation._  

--:# _Primitive turtle operations are mocked: attack, dig, place, detect, compare, drop, and suck._  

--:# _A few command computer operations are mocked: `getBlockPosition`, `getBlockInfo`, and `exec`._  

--:# commands.getBlockPosition(x: #:, y:, #:, z: #) -> _Mock position._ -> `x: #:, y:, #:, z: #`  

--:# commands.getBlockInfo(_: _: , _: _: ,_: _: , resultTable: {:}) -> _Mock info._ -> `resultTable: {:}`  

--:# commands.exec(_: _:, result: any) -> _Mock exec command._ -> `result: any`
